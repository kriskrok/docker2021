1.9: Volumes

As noted in the course material, if the file pointed to with the bind mount incantation does not exist it gets created as a directory. To circumvent possible issues I chose to create the file in the command using `touch` command.


The command used:

touch text.log && docker run -v "$(pwd)/text.log:/usr/src/app/text.log" devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service
