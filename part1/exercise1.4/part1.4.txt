1.4: Missing dependencies


I chose to append the curl installation to the script and thus had no need to manually enter the container and install curl from inside.


Command used:

docker run --rm --name missing -it ubuntu:latest sh -c 'apt-get update && apt-get -y install curl; echo "Input website:"; read website; echo "Searching.."; sleep 1; curl http://$website;'
